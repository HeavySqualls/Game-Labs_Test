# Game-Labs_Test
Application exam for a Gameplay Programmer position. 

NOTE:
This application is currently incomplete and due to current personal time constraints, continued work will be put on hold for the next week. 
I fully intend on continuing this test and completing it once I have been settled in to my new home! 

Please find questions 3 and 4 documentation in the DOCUMENTATIONS folder inside the project files. 

Thanks, 

Jordan
